# ðŸ©º Evaluating Diabetes Care Outcomes (NDA 2021â€“22)

This repository presents a data-driven case study evaluating diabetes care quality in England using the **National Diabetes Audit (NDA) 2021â€“22** dataset. The analysis compares **Type 1** and **Type 2** diabetes cohorts across key treatment and care process indicators, leveraging **Python-based EDA** and **interactive Power BI dashboards**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

- **Data Source**: National Diabetes Audit 2021â€“22 (England)
- **Tech Stack**: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Power BI
- **Key Focus**:
  - Care process completion (9 NICE checks)
  - Treatment target achievement (HbA1c, BP, Cholesterol)
  - Statin use (primary and secondary prevention)
  - Regional and organisational performance comparison
  - Correlation and performance tiering analysis

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- Type 1 patients showed significantly lower treatment target attainment (avg **32%**) vs. Type 2 (avg **36%**).
- Only **38%** of Type 1 patients received all eight care processes compared to **47%** in Type 2.
- Type 2 patients achieved **>76% combined statin prevention** and **87% secondary prevention** on average.
- Visual and statistical correlations were observed across HbA1c, BP, and cholesterol measures.
- Marked regional disparities highlight need for **targeted intervention and benchmarking**.
